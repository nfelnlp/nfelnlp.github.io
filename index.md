Welcome! 👋 I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin)
under the supervision of [Sebastian Möller](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/professur/parameter/en/) (Quality and Usability Lab) and the [Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning (BIFOLD)](https://www.bifold.berlin/) supervised by [Alexander Meyer]() (DHZC),
affiliated with the [XplaiNLP](https://xplainlp.github.io/authors/nils-feldhus/) group as a Senior Researcher
as well as with the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology) as a guest researcher.

# Research interests 👀
Advancing the interpretability of language models with the goal of increasing trust and simplifying access to explanations!  
I am open to collaborations on rationale generation, text simplification and summarization, concept explanations, biomedical and clinical NLP, and evaluation measures for model-generated text.
