Welcome! 👋 I am an incoming Postdoctoral Researcher at the Technische Universität Berlin (TU Berlin)
under the supervision of [Sebastian Möller](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/professur/parameter/en/) (Quality and Usability Lab) and the [Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning (BIFOLD)](https://www.bifold.berlin/),
affiliated with the [XplaiNLP](https://xplainlp.github.io/authors/nils-feldhus/) group as a Senior Researcher
as well as with the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology) as a guest researcher.

# Research interests 👀
My main research interest is the interpretability of language models with the goal of increasing the trust and reliability for users and simplifying access to explanations. Other topics include rationale generation, text simplification and summarization, dialogue systems, biomedical and clinical NLP, and evaluation measures for model-generated text.
