Welcome! üëã I am Nils Feldhus and am currently working on my PhD thesis in explainable natural language processing at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology) and the [Technische Universit√§t Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) under the supervision of [Sebastian M√∂ller](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/professur/parameter/en/).

# Research interests üëÄ
My main research interest is making (neural) language models more interpretable by building applications that democratize access to explanations. Topics of interest are rationale generation, data-centric interpretability, information-seeking dialogue, and evaluation measures for generated text.
