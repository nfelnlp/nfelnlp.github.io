# Welcome
Welcome to my homepage! I am Nils Feldhus and am currently working on my PhD thesis in explainable natural language processing at the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/speech-and-language-technology) and the [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/en/) under the supervision of [Sebastian Möller](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/professur/parameter/en/).

# Research interests
My main research interest is making (neural) language models more interpretable. This entails building applications that make use of explainability methods and aim to democratize access to explanations.
