# Explainability for Large Language Models

## When and where the weekly meetings will take place
* Fridays 16:00 – 18:00
* Room: Virtual via Microsoft Teams (final meeting for group presentations will take place on campus, room TBD)

## Description

Large language models like ChatGPT, Gemini and Llama for natural language processing tasks (question answering, dialogue, text classification, machine translation, etc.) are becoming increasingly commonplace and there is a growing concern if these models are responsible to use if they are poorly understood by humans (including machine learning experts).  
Explaining these models, i.e. developing computational approaches to explain the deep neural networks, helps to address the safety and ethical concerns and is essential for accountability. In the first weeks of this project, I will give introductory lectures, and we’ll go over desiderata of explanations, prompting-based approaches, data attribution, and understanding of Transformers. They will be based on tutorials presented at NAACL 2024 and EACL 2024:

* https://projects.illc.uva.nl/indeep/tutorial/ 

Our goal is the implementation of explainability methods and subsequent analysis and evaluation of the results. Special focus should be given to the implications on usability of various types of explanations and to the application to downstream tasks like question answering, fact checking, commonsense reasoning, and text classification. 

**Project requirements**
* Advanced knowledge of Python 
* Prior experience in at least one previous course/project with neural natural language processing or deep learning 
* Prior experience in at least one previous course/project with PyTorch or TensorFlow and Hugging Face
* Course language: English (student consultations can optionally be done in German) 

**Eligible modules**
* [Study Project Quality & Usability](https://www.tu.berlin/index.php?id=18763) (6LP / 9LP)
* [Interdisziplinäres Medienprojekt](https://www.tu.berlin/index.php?id=18765) (10LP)
