* TU Berlin, [QU Lab](https://www.tu.berlin/qu/)
* Room: MAR building (Room TBD), presence **required**
* Fridays, 14:00 – 16:00


## Description

As AI systems grow more powerful, there is an increasing need to make these complex black-box models interpretable and explainable. This seminar explores how data visualization techniques and interactive interfaces can provide crucial insights into how AI models operate and arrive at their outputs in order to understand what factors they are considering. The seminar covers effectively communicating AI interpretability visualizations and fairness and bias evaluations to different stakeholders. 

## Logistics
Attendees will take turns presenting [explorables](https://visxai.io), demonstrators and research papers to gain an understanding of how visualization can demystify AI, foster transparency, and enable real-world deployment of these systems in high-stakes domains. The presentations will occur throughout the semester, starting in week 4. The attendees are expected to participate in person and provide feedback to the presenters if they are not presenting themselves.

* Intermediate or advanced knowledge of machine learning
