title: "2024 Recap"
---

In 2024, I visited SIGDIAL and INLG in Japan, both of which were smaller NLP-related conferences. I also finished writing and submitted my dissertation. Meanwhile, I tried to keep track of the major conferences (ACL, EMNLP, COLM, NeurIPS, ICLR, CHI, FAccT, etc.) in terms of papers that seem relevant to my research interests. In late December, I started to write short gists for my favorite papers. In the following, I arranged them into research directions.

# NLP Interpretability
#### [Do Large Language Models Latently Perform Multi-Hop Reasoning?](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.550/) (Yang et al., ACL 2024)
This paper studies whether LLMs latently perform multi-hop reasoning when recalling entities and finds strong evidence for such reasoning pathways when certain relation types are present in the prompt. However, the utilization is highly contextual and the evidence for the second hop and the entire traversal is rather moderate. With increasing model size, this behavior is more pronounced with the first hop.

#### [DynamicQA: Tracing Internal Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-emnlp.838/) (Marjanović, Yu et al., EMNLP 2024 Findings)
DynamicQA is a dataset for real-world knowledge conflicts where facts can change over time (temporal) or have dynamic properties (disputable). The authors propose two measures for intra-memory conflicts, semantic entropy and coherent persuasion score, and find that LMs more often struggle with dynamic facts compared to facts with a single possible value.

# Rationale Generation
#### [Digital Socrates: Evaluating LLMs through explanation critiques](https://aclanthology.org/2024.acl-long.302/) (Gu, Tafjord & Clark, ACL 2024)
The authors create a dataset of multiple-choice QA problems and model-generated explanations and test if critique models can detect flaws in reasoning chains pertaining to the explanations.

#### [ACORN: Aspect-wise Commonsense Reasoning Explanation Evaluation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=2oHnsM9M9D) (Brassard et al., COLM 2024)
This paper presents a new dataset of free-text explanations alongside aspect-wise quality ratings to evaluate how LLMs rate explanations. The authors find that while larger models predicted labels in the commonsense reasoning tasks that more often aligned with human annotators, they can be inconsistent across the quality aspects.

In a controlled experiment with 119 ML practitioners, giving them access to interpretability tools resulted in 5x less time spent on the task and 17% less accuracy about the data and the model, showing an inclination towards "good enough" understanding.

Their dataset ConflictingQA deals with the problem that RAG models are increasingly tasked with subjective and ambiguous queries and pairs such queries with documents as evidence in different categories. They find that models heavily rely on the relevance of a website to the query and ignore stylistic features that humans find important (presence of scientific references, neutral tone).

To rebut the criticism that interpretability research lacks actionable insights and impact on NLP, the authors construct a manually annotated citation graph and conduct a survey of members of the NLP community. They find that NLP researchers build on findings from the interpretability field and perceive it as important for progress in NLP and that highly influential work outside of interpretability often cites these findings.

The order in which the papers appeared does not indicate any ranking.  
Most papers are in their final (peer-reviewed and published) version safe for very few exceptions (mostly surveys). If I assume an arXiv pre-print to appear at some conference in 2025, I will not mention it and save it for next year.
